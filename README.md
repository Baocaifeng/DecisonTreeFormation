Decision Tree based on ID3 algorithm
=====================================================
In machine learning and decision tree algorithms, ID3 is a simple but efficient algorithm to classify unseen data.

Usage
-----
 
The input should be a file containing the training data.
The format of training data is as follows:
    A. At the first line put the attribute (column) names separated by comma without space charachter.
    B. In the consequnce lines, attribue values must come in the order of attribute names and separated by comma.
The output is a decision tree and its demonstration.

Two samples are provided for test. One that decides based on some features that someone should wait for a 
table in a resturant (resturant.dat). The other is whether a student should go to a party or  to study based on current conditions (party.dat).
